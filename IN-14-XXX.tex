% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
\abstract{
CMS data is ordered in datasets, which have some common properties and are usually analyzed together. As data taking progresses and Monte Carlo tools improve, datasets are often replaced and site administrators have to identify and delete out-dated datasets. Dynamic Data Management is a novel method to automatically manage the distribution and deletion of datasets. In this note, we describe a metric of DDM performance, based on the number of user requests per dataset replica.

% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible. For APS submissions, they are automatically converted to APS keywords.
