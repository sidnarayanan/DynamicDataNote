The remaining variables are relatively easily calculated. The number of files and size of a dataset are gotten from DAS. It should be noted that we assume each replica is a ``full'' replica. An incomplete replica may be missing files and consequently a smaller size. We compute $\Na$ using the caches maintained by Detox. Detox is the Dynamic Data Management tool which deals with the deletion of deprecated datasets and under-utilized replicas. In order to make the latter decision, Detox keeps a local record of the number of accesses made to each replica of each dataset, derived from the popularity API. $\Na$ for a dataset is defined as the total number of accesses over all replicas of that dataset.
